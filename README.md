# iFit Coach Mock-up

*This is a mock-up of the sketch file sent for the coding challenge.*

Thank you so much for this opportunity! It was fun making this mock-up, and I hope my work speaks for itself.

## Instructions

To run this code, either:

1. visit the current working environment: [https://ldail.github.io/iFit-mockup/](iFit Mockup)
2. Run `npm start` in the terminal.
3. Use 'serve', then build and deploy a version locally.

## Challenges Accepted

I opted to completed a few of the challenges in this two-day window span. 

* Animate and fade in the hero text
* Animate cards in the grid section on hover
* Set up the language picker in the footer to "select" different languages (display a list of languages and replace the label when clicked)
* Create a fixed header that hides once the user scrolls past the hero section


## Notes

* There is currently a developer warning for using '#' as the link href. This is only done because there are no real links to direct the user to, so I used the standard '#'.
* The mock-up seemed to be a desktop version of the website, so there was some leniency in the mobile version. I hope the small changes I made are acceptable.
* I minimized the image files so the site would be more performant.
* Since this is a static site, it could have been developed in Gatsby or even vanilla JavaScript, but I chose React with Create-React-App in order to show off my strongest skillset.
